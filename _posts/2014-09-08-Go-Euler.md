title: Go Euler

New job, new apartment, impromptu blog hiatus now ending. I have made no progress on the robots at all. There are pieces of code I have written for the new light seeking algorithm, but nothing functional and nothing tested.
In other news, I need to learn go, because I have a new job (yeah another one) coming up, I have started project Euler again but this time in go. I am also learning flask.
