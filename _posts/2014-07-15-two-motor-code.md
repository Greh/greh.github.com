title: Two Motor Code
---

There are two programs I need to write for this. One is crosswiring in code. which is literally the same as the one motor code but two of them. Done.  

The other program I need to make is significantly harder. This program is one function instead of two. Instead of right eye controls left motor and left eye controls right motor, I need to make input from both eyes controls both motors. The case break down is annoying, but I have decided to go with the dumber route for now and have each cycle start by forcing a safe state. Eventually, I hope to eliminate that step. 
 
So far I just have to be extra careful about which pin does what and constantly refering back to the diagrams. This is extremely tedious and feels perhaps unnecessary. I will try to make it more elegant later.
