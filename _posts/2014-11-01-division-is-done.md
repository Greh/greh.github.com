title: Division is done

Probably. More accurately, I have written addition, sutraction, multiplication, division, a few other necessary things, and so far all the tests pass so everything probably works. Probably. 

A few weeks ago, I deleted my command prompt. And fixed it promptly. I want to say I learned something from the experience like not to delete things from my dotfiles if I do not know what they do, but I will probably never stop doing that.
