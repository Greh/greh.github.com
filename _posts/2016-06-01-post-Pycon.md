Highlights reel:  

[Seriously String Security on Shoestring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FeNdXzVLEs)    
Kelsey Gilmore-Innis  
I have a soft spot for security talks, but also a general fear that I wont understand what they are talking about or how to use the information, but that is not the case with this talk. Probably for the first time ever, I left a security talk feeling like I could actually use the information presented.   
Do not watch this video with headpones on; there were some issues with the sound and you could hurt your ears.  

[What Is and What Can Be: An Exploration From Type to MetaClasses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI0JUY2qd2A)  
Dustin Ingram  
This talk falls pretty heavily in the "I hope I never need this information" pile, but I enjoyed learning it any how, and the talk was suprisingly easy to follow.

[Teaching Python: The Hard Parts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYEpVNbM-s)  
Elana Hashman  
I am just in love with this talk. Any one who has seen me speak about teaching git knows I try really hard to not overload students with information, and Elana has a very clear idea of what a beginner *needs* to know when learning python versus what they can learn later.  

[Removing Pythons Gil: The Gilectomy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3AyI_u66Bw)  
Larry Hastings  
I do not even know what to say about this, but if you have been writing python for more than a year or so, you will definitely love this talk.
