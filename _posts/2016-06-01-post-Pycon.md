title: Post Pycon 
---

First of all, thank you Brandon Rhodes for the amazing Welcome to Pycon and Portland speech; especially for taking the time to make it *absolutely* clear that at the end of every talk if you want to ask a question, it must be an actual question.  
I managed to not wear myself too thin by prioritizing down time and eating veggies. Conveniently, Pycon videos are online within a day of when the talk was given, making it very easy for me to skip every talk scheduled right before lunch.  
Also I met Guido!  

Highlights reel:  

[Seriously Strong Security on Shoestring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FeNdXzVLEs)    
Kelsey Gilmore-Innis  
I have a soft spot for security talks, but also a general fear that I wont understand what they are talking about or how to use the information, but that is not the case with this talk. Probably for the first time ever, I left a security talk feeling like I could actually use the information presented.   
Do not watch this video with headpones on; there were some issues with the sound and you could hurt your ears.  

[What Is and What Can Be: An Exploration From Type to MetaClasses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI0JUY2qd2A)  
Dustin Ingram  
This talk falls pretty heavily in the "I hope I never need this information" pile, but I enjoyed learning it any how, and the talk was suprisingly easy to follow.

[Teaching Python: The Hard Parts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYEpVNbM-s)  
Elana Hashman  
I am just in love with this talk. Any one who has seen me speak about teaching git knows I try really hard to not overload students with information, and Elana has a very clear idea of what a beginner *needs* to know when learning python versus what they can learn later.  

[Removing Pythons Gil: The Gilectomy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3AyI_u66Bw)  
Larry Hastings  
I do not even know what to say about this, other than, I hope it works. Larry Hastings is attempting to remove the Global Interpreter Lock and this talk lays out what wont work and what might work.  

[When is it Good to be Bad: Web Scraping and Data Analysis of NHL Penalties](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW02_GnQKeM)  
Wendy Grus  
This talk was so much fun. It starts with a little intro to hockey which I needed, clearly introduces an interesting problem to solve, and then solves it Python. I will be using this talk as an example to all beginners of what conference talk should look like.
