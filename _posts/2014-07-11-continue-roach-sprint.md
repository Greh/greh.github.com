I have written the H-bridge free code; the H-bridge code requires more thought.  

On the subject of testing, how do you test a transitor? With resistors and diodes you just test them normally but what do you do with transistors? Make the part of a circuit and flip them on and off again? (I know they are not 'on' or 'off', wicker). Anyway, I do not know how to test my H-bridge transitors or phototransitors.
