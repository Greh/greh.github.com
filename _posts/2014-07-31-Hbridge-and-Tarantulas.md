title: H Bridge and Tarantulas
---

I found a solution to the H-bridge problem with help from Jamey and Chris. I need to figure out how to make arrays in C. If I make a clockwise and counter clockwise function then by the nature of defining movement, I will not need safe states. This of course makes all the code I was working on for the last two weeks obsolete.

I learned how to clean a turtle today and I held a python. I also learned that tarantulas molt. The skin they leave behind is only less scary than the actual tarantula because you know its not alive. If you have trypophobia, it might be worse though.
