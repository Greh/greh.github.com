title: H Bridge and Tarantulas
---

I found a solution to the H-bridge problem with help from Jamey and Chris. I need to figure out how to make arrays in C. If I make a clockwise and counter clockwise function then by the nature of defining movement, I will not need safe states.

I learned how to clean a turtle today and I held a python. I also learned that tarantulas molt. The skin they leave behind is nightmare fuel.
